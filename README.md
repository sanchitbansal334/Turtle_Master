## About project:
* User runs the program and enters his/her name or any string. the program then separates each character from the name and calls turtle function for every character. 
* A new window opens with dark-grey background and turtle drawing letters, symbols and spaces one by one. 
* The Speed, fill and color of turtle can be controlled at back-end. 
* Spaces present in between any two characters, and extra spaces present in between two words, are taken care of.
